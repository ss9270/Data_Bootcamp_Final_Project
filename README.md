Project Description

Founded in 2008, Zomato is a restaurant search service based in India. Much like Yelp, the company seeks to provide users with restaurant information like cuisine and general price and to allow them to leave reviews. Zomato operates in 24 countries and thus has global footprint.

We were interested in seeing the relationship specifically between a restaurant's price and cuisine and its rating. Certain cuisines tend to be considered "high-end" and therefore command a higher price point for a meal. Moreover, because price tends to signal quality, especially in the restaurant industry, the food and service should be relatively better.

Through analysis of Zomato data, we hope to test two hypotheses as follows: restaurants with cuisines that connotate fine dining (specifically French and Japanese) will have a higher price point and thus rating, and restaurants with a higher price will have higher ratings left by reviewers.
